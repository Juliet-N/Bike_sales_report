The company wanted me to analyses the bike sales in this company. Derive insightful KPI's that affects the sales of bike and give further insights about the data

## The Data

## The tools used for this analysis includes;

- Pivot table
- Pivot Chart
- Slicers.

## Insights gotten from the analysis are as follows;

- Males purchased more bikes than females.
- Single people purchase are higher than the married.
- Income is not a factor that prevents the married customers from purchasing  bikes as there were customers that earned more but did purhase any bikes.
- Married customers with 1 kid purchased more bikes than married customers with no-kids or 2-kids, and married customers with 4-kids purchsed more bikes than married customers with 3 and 5-kids while though the single customers with no kids purchased more bikes, single customers with 2 and 3-kids purchased bikes higher than those with either 1,4 or 5 kids.
- More customers under the mid-age category purchased more bike than the adolenscent and old group.
